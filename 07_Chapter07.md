# Chapter 7: MapReduce with Hadoop

Welcome to Chapter 7 of "Online Map Reduce Algorithms in Optimal Cython". In the previous chapter, we explored various parallelization techniques used in MapReduce algorithms to optimize their performance. In this chapter, we will dive deeper into the world of MapReduce and explore the popular distributed processing framework Hadoop.

Hadoop is a widely-used open-source framework that is used to process and store large datasets in a distributed environment. It has become the go-to framework for big data processing due to its ability to handle massive amounts of data in parallel.

Hadoop allows you to process large datasets by splitting them into smaller chunks called "blocks" that are distributed across a cluster of machines. These blocks can be processed in parallel, allowing for faster processing times and improved efficiency.

Using Hadoop with MapReduce allows you to write MapReduce algorithms that can be executed on a Hadoop cluster. This combination provides a powerful tool for processing big data, making it easier to handle even the largest datasets with ease.

In this chapter, we will explore the different components of Hadoop and how they work together in a MapReduce job. We will also walk through the process of setting up a Hadoop cluster and running a MapReduce job on it.

So, let's get started with Hadoop and explore how it can be used with MapReduce to process large datasets efficiently.
